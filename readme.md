# RIP Simulation Project

This is a multi-crate Rust project to model cosmic phenomena based on rip field theories.

## Structure

- [`rip-core`](./rip-core) - Core simulation library, containing physics constants, decay functions, and simulation configurations.
- [`rip-inf`](./rip-inf) - Inflation simulation based on rip field dynamics.
- [`rip-de`](./rip-de) - Dark energy simulation using rip field decay over cosmological timescales.

## How to Build and Test

Clone the repository and move to the project root:

```bash
cd rip
