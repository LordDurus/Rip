# A Rip-Based Model for Cosmic Expansion

## Abstract
We present a speculative physical model in which dark energy emerges from the gradual destruction of matter and energy by rips in spacetime, potentially located at the cores of supermassive black holes. This mechanism results in a cumulative tension field — the "rip field" — that grows over time and produces an outward pressure consistent with the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion.

## Motivation
The standard ΛCDM cosmological model treats dark energy as a cosmological constant: a uniform, unchanging energy density that permeates space. While this fits observational data well, it lacks a physical mechanism. Our model proposes that instead of a static cosmological constant, the accelerating expansion is driven by a slow, cumulative loss of matter and energy through rips in spacetime.

## Core Hypothesis
- Supermassive black holes at galactic centers occasionally cause permanent erasure of infalling matter via spacetime rips.
- These rips remove mass-energy from the universe entirely, violating conservation laws locally but producing a global field effect.
- The accumulated effect manifests as a growing tension field ("rip field") exerting outward pressure on spacetime.
- This rip field mimics dark energy and may naturally flatten over time, aligning with ΛCDM observations.

## Methodology
We simulate a toy universe consisting of 1,000 galaxies, each containing a central black hole. At each timestep:

- Galaxies receive stochastic matter inflow.
- With some probability, mass falling into a black hole is destroyed rather than absorbed.
- The amount of destroyed mass is used to increase a global rip field value.
- This field is assumed to be proportional to outward pressure.

We normalize the resulting field against the current measured dark energy density of ~\( 7 \times 10^{-27} \ \text{kg/m}^3 \).

### Simulation Parameters
| Parameter         | Description                               | Value            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `NUM_GALAXIES`   | Number of galaxies in simulation          | 1000             |
| `SIM_DURATION`   | Total simulation time                     | 13,800 Myr       |
| `TIME_STEP`      | Time step interval                        | 100 Myr          |
| `INITIAL_MASS`   | Mass of each galaxy (solar masses)        | \(1.0 \times 10^{12}\) |
| `INITIAL_BH_MASS`| Initial BH mass per galaxy (solar masses) | \(1.0 \times 10^8\)  |
| `NUM_RUNS`       | Number of independent simulation runs     | 10               |

### Equations Used
Rip field increment from lost mass:
\[
\Delta \text{rip\_field} = \frac{\Delta m \cdot G}{c^2}
\]
Where:
- \( \Delta m \): mass destroyed in rip (kg)
- \( G \): gravitational constant
- \( c \): speed of light

### Simulation Details
- Written in Rust for speed and precision.
- Run in ensembles of 10 simulations.
- CSV output analyzed and plotted using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib).
- Average curve and envelope compared to constant ΛCDM line.

## Results
The rip field grows slowly at first, then accelerates and begins to flatten — matching the characteristic shape of cosmological expansion under ΛCDM. The variance across runs is small, and the average closely approaches the redshift-normalized value of dark energy.

## Possible Outcomes for Exiting Matter
To frame the novelty of this idea, we compare various scenarios that might occur when matter enters a black hole:

| Fate of Matter        | Effect on Gravity | Effect on Expansion | Alignment with Rip Model |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Stored behind horizon| Static            | None                 | ❌                        |
| Ejected into jets    | Preserved         | Local disturbance    | ❌                        |
| Reemitted (Hawking)  | Minimal loss      | Slow leak            | ❌                        |
| **Erased by rip**    | **Lost**          | **Tension buildup**  | ✅                        |

This highlights that only permanent erasure produces a net change in gravitational field and thus might contribute to expansion pressure.

## Implications
This model offers:
- A potential physical mechanism behind dark energy.
- A natural explanation for the timing of accelerated expansion (5–7 billion years ago).
- A framework that may accommodate dynamic evolution of the expansion rate.

## Future Work
- Derive an analytical expression for the rip field evolution.
- Add spatial dimensions and clustering.
- Explore ripple-back effects (feedback from rip field on galaxy evolution).
- Compare against observed H(z), BAO, and SN1a datasets.

## Author Notes
This project is a conceptual exploration inspired by dissatisfaction with the notion of an unexplained cosmological constant. It is not intended as a formal theory, but as a computational thought experiment — one that seems to be surprisingly well-aligned with current data.
