# Rip Field Inflation and the Birth of Cosmic Structure

## 1. Introduction

This paper presents a simulation-based model of the early universe under the influence of a novel field — the **rip field** — that drives inflation and seeds the formation of the large-scale cosmic structure. 

By visualizing the growth of filamentary networks, black hole anchoring, and gravitational wells, this project reconstructs the initial framework from which galaxies, clusters, and voids emerged.

## 2. Simulation Framework

### 2.1 Overview

- The simulation begins with a uniform grid representing spacetime cells.
- A **rip field** drives inflation, gradually decaying while inducing structure through gravitational interactions.
- A procedural growth model is used to simulate filaments emerging from a central seed point.

### 2.2 Key Parameters

- Grid size: 64x64
- Timesteps: 100
- Growth logic: neighbor-based probabilistic seeding
- Gravity field: derived from curvature and smoothed density
- Black holes: seeded and tracked for latching onto filaments

## 3. Visualization Highlights

### 3.1 Filament Growth

- White filament lines represent dense structures in the early universe.
- Fade logic emphasizes long-term gravitational viability.
- Background stars and pulsating glow highlight filament complexity.

### 3.2 Black Hole Latching

- Black holes (aqua) drift until they encounter filament matter.
- Once latched, they glow green and pulse subtly.
- Their presence stabilizes filaments and prevents fading.

### 3.3 Gravity-Based Filtering

- Weak filaments with shallow gravitational wells fade over time.
- This replicates how voids emerge where matter fails to accumulate.
- Gravity threshold: 0.08 (empirical for best visibility)

## 4. Observational Parallels

The simulation shows key features aligned with modern large-scale structure observations:

- Emergence of **cosmic filaments** from inflation
- Development of **voids** in low-gravity regions
- Stabilization of key nodes through **black hole anchoring**

## 5. Future Work

This model lays the groundwork for a second-stage simulation:

- Simulate **post-inflation structure formation**
- Include **dark matter collapse**, galaxy formation, and baryonic feedback
- Track evolution from filament network to **observable large-scale structure**
